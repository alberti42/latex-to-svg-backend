;;; Commentary:
;;
;; A small, buffer-agnostic engine that turns a LaTeX math string into an
;; SVG image suitable for overlaying in an Emacs buffer.  It is the
;; rendering core extracted from `agent-shell-math-renderer'; front-ends
;; (agent-shell's markdown renderer, an Org preview mode, ...) do their own
;; equation detection and image *placement* and delegate the actual
;; typesetting here.
;;
;; Design (why it is cheap to recolor and rescale):
;;
;;   * Equations are compiled with `latex' + `dvisvgm' to a standalone SVG,
;;     content-addressed on disk (SHA-1 of LaTeX + preamble + style).  Each
;;     unique equation therefore compiles at most once, ever, and the cache
;;     is shared across every front-end.
;;
;;   * The on-disk SVG is COLOR-INDEPENDENT: dvisvgm `--currentcolor' emits
;;     the default ink as the literal token `currentColor', which is
;;     substituted with the buffer foreground at display time.  A theme
;;     switch therefore re-tints from cache with no recompile.  The image
;;     background is transparent, so it always matches the buffer.
;;
;;   * The on-disk SVG is SIZE-INDEPENDENT: it is compiled at dvisvgm
;;     `--scale=1' (natural point dimensions, glyphs as outline paths) and
;;     scaled at display time via `create-image' :scale, computed from the
;;     buffer font height so equations track the font — again no recompile.
;;
;;   * The preamble is PRECOMPILED once to a LaTeX format file (`.fmt') via
;;     the `mylatexformat' package, then loaded by every equation compile
;;     with a `%&' first line (see `latex-to-svg-backend-precompile').  This skips
;;     re-parsing the class and packages (amsmath, ...) on each equation, so
;;     compiles are markedly faster.  It falls back to a full compile when
;;     `mylatexformat' is unavailable or the dump fails.
;;
;;   * The cache is SHARDED into 256 subdirectories (by the first two hex
;;     characters of the content key) so no single directory accumulates
;;     every equation, and is bounded by an age-limited garbage collector
;;     (`latex-to-svg-backend-gc') that deletes equations untouched for a
;;     while and runs automatically about once a day (see
;;     `latex-to-svg-backend-gc-interval').
;;
;; Public entry point:
;;
;;   (latex-to-svg-backend LATEX &key callback)
;;
;; LATEX is placed *verbatim* in the document body, so the caller passes
;; valid body LaTeX and decides inline vs display by the delimiters it uses
;; (`$x$', `\(x\)', `\[x\]', `\begin{equation}...\end{equation}', ...).
;; The engine is deliberately unaware of that distinction.
;;
;; Returns an image now when one can be produced synchronously (cache /
;; on-disk SVG / placeholder), else nil after scheduling an asynchronous
;; compile; CALLBACK (a zero-argument function) is invoked once the SVG is
;; ready, so the caller can re-query and place the image.  Concurrent
;; requests for the same equation are coalesced onto a single compile.
;;
;; Helpers a front-end typically needs for its refresh policy:
;; `latex-to-svg-backend-available-p', `latex-to-svg-backend-appearance',
;; `latex-to-svg-backend-display-scale', and `latex-to-svg-backend-foreground-color'.

LATEX is placed verbatim in the document body (the caller supplies
valid body LaTeX and chooses inline vs display via delimiters).
Writes a standalone LaTeX document, runs `latex-to-svg-backend-latex-program'
then `latex-to-svg-backend-dvisvgm-program' in a scratch directory, and on
success caches the SVG and notifies every callback queued for KEY
\(see `latex-to-svg-backend--enqueue').  The scratch directory is removed when
the process exits.

The preamble is loaded from a precompiled format file (`.fmt') when one
is available (see `latex-to-svg-backend-precompile'), via a `%&' first line;
otherwise the full preamble is embedded in the document.  On failure,
if a format was used it may be the culprit: the format is abandoned (see

the log saved and a warning emitted (see `latex-to-svg-backend--compile-failed')

No color is baked in: the equation's default ink is emitted as the
literal `currentColor' (dvisvgm `--currentcolor'), so the SVG is
color-independent and is tinted to the buffer foreground at display
time (`latex-to-svg-backend--load-svg-image').  A theme change therefore

  "Return an SVG image for LATEX, or nil while it compiles.

METADATA, when non-nil and `latex-to-svg-backend-metadata-prefix' is set, is the
INITIAL value stored in this equation's `.eld' sidecar (see
`latex-to-svg-backend-metadata'); the FINAL value is captured from the compile
log.  It is only recorded when a compile actually runs (a miss).

RESCALE-BY (default 1.0) multiplies the base display size for this one
call, on top of the global `latex-to-svg-backend-font-scale'.  The engine has no
inline/display awareness; a front-end that wants display equations a
touch larger than inline passes, say, `:rescale-by 1.1' for display and
nothing for inline.  It is a display-time scale only — same on-disk SVG,
no recompile — and folds into the in-memory image cache key, so the two
sizes coexist.

LATEX is placed *verbatim* in the LaTeX document body, so it must be
valid there: pass math with its delimiters (`$x$', `\\(x\\)', `\\[x\\]')
or a full environment (`\\begin{equation}...\\end{equation}').  The
delimiters also choose inline vs display sizing — the engine does not.

Returns immediately with:

  * the placeholder panel image, when `latex-to-svg-backend-use-placeholder'
    is set or the toolchain is unavailable (see
    `latex-to-svg-backend--placeholder');
  * the cached / on-disk equation image when it is ready;
  * nil when equations aren't renderable (see
    `latex-to-svg-backend-available-p') — the caller keeps the raw text.

When the equation is renderable but not yet compiled, returns nil and
schedules an asynchronous compile; CALLBACK (a zero-argument function)
is invoked once, when the SVG is ready, so the caller can re-query
\(call `latex-to-svg-backend' again, which now returns the image) and place
it.  Concurrent requests for the same equation share one compile.

The image is tinted to the current buffer foreground and scaled to
the buffer font at build time, so call within the target buffer."
